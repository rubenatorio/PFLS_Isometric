1) Create property for Player.h that holds the current tile position, this will save time from calling IsometricConverter::tilePosFromLocation 
    lots of times in the level
    
2) move TestLevelLayer::directionFromLocation to the IcometricConverter class

3) remove player's owner dependecy (e.g. move current map and layer properties to the game manager)

4) invidible tiles should not be considered when touching the screen

5) Experiment with tile alpha so it is slightly translucent when player is behind

6) invisible tiles should be touchable
